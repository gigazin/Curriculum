                Born in 2001 at Recife, Pernambuco, I'm a brazilian programmer and designer. I had my first contacts with a computer <br /> when I was still a child, around 2005. Since the very first time I got to use a computer I started wondering myself "how it works?". <br /> But, as the time passed by I ended up forgetting about it as I was too young to search for answers.

                As I grew up, this question came back to my mind, levering my interest for computers and the engineering behind them. <br /> So I spent my entire high school period studying about computers, their history, programming and design as well, which was my <br /> main working goal back then. It was, undoubtedly, the period where I learned the most in my life.

                After graduating from high school in 2019 I started studying to join a Computer Science college. The target <br /> was joining a public university (Federal University of Pernambuco), but unfortunately my grade was too low. But, as <br /> we brazilians like to say - I'm brazilian, and I never give up.

                After failing my first attempt to join college in a public university, I tried once again, but a private one this <br /> time around, and I did it! My second option was the Catholic University of Pernambuco, and I joined it by the second <br /> half of 2020, fortunately with a full scholarship as I couldn't afford the monthly payment of the course.

                And now I'm currently studying Computer Science, already at the 5th semester of college and very close to <br /> reach my dream of graduating, with expectations to do it in December 2024. This dream has a huge meaning to me, <br /> as it was my father's dream to see his son graduating, but unfortunately he passed away when I was halfway through <br /> the course.
